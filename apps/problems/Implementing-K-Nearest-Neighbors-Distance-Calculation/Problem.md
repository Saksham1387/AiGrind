## Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors Distance Calculation

Implement a function to compute the Euclidean distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. 

### Input

- **point1** (list of float): Coordinates of the first point.
- **point2** (list of float): Coordinates of the second point.

### Output

- **result**  (float): The Euclidean distance between the two points.

### Examples

#### Example 1

*Input:*

point1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
point2 = [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]

*Output:*

5.196

#### Example 2

*Input:*

point1 = [0.0, 0.0]
point2 = [3.0, 4.0]

*Output:*

5.0
